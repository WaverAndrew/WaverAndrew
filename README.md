Hey, Iâ€™m Andrea ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a 20-year-old student from Milan, Italy, driven by curiosity, a love for startups, and the magic of bringing ideas to life through technology.

I started coding at 11, but what captivated me wasnâ€™t just programmingâ€”it was the excitement of seeing ideas transform into something real. Each project Iâ€™ve tackled taught me valuable lessons, fueling my passion for innovation and entrepreneurship.

Hereâ€™s a quick look at some of the projects Iâ€™ve built along the way:
	â€¢	Instascanner (2017-2018): An automated Instagram influencer discovery tool. I learned early on how challenging maintaining third-party integrations can be at scale.
	â€¢	Eaglecam (2019): A custom AI neural network to extract the best-looking photos from videosâ€”my first deep dive into AI, done at 15.
	â€¢	Idemos (2021-2022): A Web3 personalization platform for NFTs, scaling to $30k/month and winning recognition from Italyâ€™s largest bank.
	â€¢	Eurys (2024): Currently building an AI-powered search engine for connecting people, transitioning from backend to full-stack development.


Feel free to connect or say hiâ€”Iâ€™m always excited to meet fellow innovators and creators!
