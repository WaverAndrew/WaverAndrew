# Hi, I'm Andrea :)

📍 Milan, Italy |  Student, Tech Enthusiast & Entrepreneur |

I'm a **20-year-old student** driven by curiosity, passion for startups, and the thrill of turning ideas into reality through technology.

I began coding at **11**, quickly discovering my love not just for writing code, but for creating products that people genuinely love and use.

## 🛠️ Projects I'm proud of:


- **🦅 Eaglecam (2019)**: Built a custom AI neural network at 15 to automatically select the best photos from videos—my first venture into deep learning.

- **🔍 Eurys (2024)**: Created an AI-powered search engine designed to connect people effortlessly. Transitioning from backend to full-stack development.

- **📚 Ubooks (2024-25)**: A peer-to-peer university book marketplace that attracted over 30 000 visits in its first month—20 % of my university’s students use it.

- **🤖 EVE (Evolutionary Visual Explorer) (2025)**: Crafting a multi-agent brain to give drones real-time vision capabilities. Coming very soon :)

## 🎯 Interests outside tech:

- **🎾 Tennis** | **🏂 Snowboarding** | **📖 Reading**
